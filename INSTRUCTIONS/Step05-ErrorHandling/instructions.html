	<h1>Custom Error Handling and Debugging</h1>
	<p>
		In our development environment we want to see all error details in the browser, but on the live site we don't want users seeing them.
		Instead we want them to see a 'friendly' message, and we want the ugly details of the error to be emailed to us (so that we are aware that an error occured on the live site).
		In this step, we'll set up custom error handling.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Update the config file (config.inc.php) to look like <a href="screen-shots/1-config-file.png">this</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We've added some new constants to our config file, DEBUG_MODE and ADMIN_EMAIL
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Set <b>ADMIN_EMAIL</b> to be your email address.</li>
				<li>Set <b>DEBUG_MODE</b> to true for localhost and false for the live site settings.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The reason for DEBUG_MODE is that sometimes we do want to display error messages on the live site,
				for example if we there is an error occurring on the live site, but not on dev.
				In that case, we can simply change DEBUG_MODE to true for the live site settings.
				Notice that we've added an IF statement that checks to see if we are in debug mode, 
				if so we want PHP to display all error messages.
				Make sure to set ADMIN_EMAIL to your own email address.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Now we are going to add a few functions to the config file. 
				Functions defined in the config file will be available to all web pages.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					First add sendEmail() which will be a 'wrapper' function for the built-in mail() function in PHP.
					<br>
					<a href="screen-shots/2-sendEmail.png">This</a> is what the function should look like.
					<br>
					Put the function at the bottom of the config file, note that I have put a comment between the functions and the rest of the code above.
					We could just use the mail() function when we want to send an email from a page, but instead will
					call sendEmail(). This gives us the flexibilty to update the sendEmail() function in the future without
					having to update all pages that may have otherwised used mail();
					<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>
					Now we'll add our own custom error handler function and after that we'll set it to be the function that PHP calls when it encounters an error.
					<br>
					<a href="custom-error-function.txt">Here</a> is the code.
					<br>
					Note that if we are in debug mode, and error is displayed in the browser, otherwise the error message is sent to the ADMIN_EMAIL address and we redirect the user to a page that displays a 'friendly' error message.
					Don't forget the code that calls set_error_handler(), this will tell PHP to invoke customErrorHandler() when an error occurs.
					We'll create the error.php page next.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Adding an Error Page</h3>
			<p>
			Create a file inside the 'my-new-site' folder named <b>error.php</b>.
			You can copy the contents of the site home page into it and then make the following changes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Update the page specific variables ($pageTitle, $pageDescription, $sideBar).</li>
				<li>
					Update the content within the <b>main</b> tag so that it displays a friendy message
					make sure that you mention that you have been notified of the error and will fix it asap.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Test It!</h3>
			<p>
			Go ahead and generate an error in the code of the site's home page (echo a variable that doesn't exist).
			You should see your custom error handling function.
			</p>
			<p>
			At this point you should push the files to your live server and make sure that you see the 'friendly' error page, and make sure you get the error email.
			</p>
			<p>
				SIDE NOTE: I did not add a SERVER error header to the error page. 
				Normally whan an error occurs on the web server, we should technically return a HTTP status code of 500.
				We'll talk more about http headers later in the course.
