	<h1>Blog Post Page</h1>
	
	<h3>Pre-Reqs</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Understanding of URL query string parameters and the $_GET super global array in PHP</li>
		<li>Understanding of 404 pages and headers</li>
		<li>Understanding of SQL injection attacks</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In this step, we'll create a single PHP page that can display any blog post (very dynamic!).
		Before we start on that page, we'll need to add some more code to our PageDataAccess class.
	</p>

	<h3>Updating the PageDataAccess class</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Open PageDataAccess.inc.php and add this method to it:
			<pre>
// Get a page by it's id
function getPageById($id){

	// prevent SQL injection attack by 'scrubbing' the $id
	$id = mysqli_real_escape_string($this->link, $id);

	$qStr = "SELECT 
				pageId, 
				path, 
				title,
				description,
				content,
				categories.categoryId, 
				categories.name as categoryName,
				DATE_FORMAT(publishedDate,'%m/%e/%Y') as publishedDate, 
				pages.active 
			FROM pages
			INNER JOIN categories on pages.categoryId = categories.categoryId
			WHERE pageId = {$id}";

	$result = mysqli_query($this->link, $qStr) or $this->handleError(mysqli_error($this->link));

	if(mysqli_num_rows($result) == 1){
		$row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
		$page = array();
		$page['pageId'] = htmlentities($row['pageId']);
		$page['path'] = htmlentities($row['path']);
		$page['title'] = htmlentities($row['title']);
		$page['description'] = htmlentities($row['description']);
		$page['content'] = $row['content']; // Note that we are not using htmlentities() here!!!
		$page['categoryId'] = htmlentities($row['categoryId']);
		$page['categoryName'] = htmlentities($row['categoryName']);
		$page['publishedDate'] = htmlentities($row['publishedDate']);
		$page['active'] = htmlentities($row['active']);
		return $page;
	}else{
		return false;
	}
}
			</pre>
			Note that we are not using htmlentities() on the content column. We talk about that soon.
		</li>
		<li>
			Open <b>page-data-access-tests.php</b> and add <a href="screen-shots/1-test-code.png">this</a> code to it. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Open the test page in the browser to make sure it's properly fetching a blog page.
			Note that the code also verifies that if there is an error in the SQL statement, the handleError() method is invoked.
			Also note that we have confirmed that the handleError() method is throwing an exception, just as it should do.
			We caught the exception with our test code.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Create a 404 page</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Inside the <b>my-new-site</b> folder, create a page named <b>404.php</b></li>
		<li>You can copy code from another page and then make changes if you want, but the page should look something like <a href="404-page.txt">this</a> when you are done.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Add another global function to the config file (it will redirect users to  a 'page not found' page)</h3>
	<ul>	
		<li>Add <a href="screen-shots/3-redirect.png">this</a> function to the bottom of the config file.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Create the Blog Post Page</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Inside the <b>blog</b> folder, create a page called <b>blog-post.php</b></li>
		<li>Set up the page to look like <a href="blog-post.txt">this</a></li>
		<li>Test out the blog post page by first going to the blog home page.</li>
		<li>Try playing around the pageId url query string parameter to make sure the the page is properly redirecting to the 404 page.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Allowing Markup in the Page Content</h3>
	<p>
		Notice in the getPageId() method that we are not 'scrubbing' the content column when fetching
		a post from the database (by using htmlentities()). 
		The reason for this is that we want to allow SOME tags to be included in the content. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Open PHPMyAdmin and update the active post to include some html markup.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Preventing XSS Atacks</h3>
	<p>
		Take a look at the getPageById() method that we created earlier and note that 
		we are not using htmlentities() on the 'content' when we fetch it from the database.
		The reason for this, is that we want to allow you to add <b>some</b> HTML tags so that you structure/style the content on your blog posts.
		But this opens a huge security vulnerability in our code. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Now would be a good time for me to demonstrate a <b>cross-site scripting attack</b>
		and then I'll show you how we can try to prevent them from happening.
		If a hacker finds a way to insert/update certain information into your database, he/she might be able to pull off an XSS attack.
		Right now, it may be difficult for hackers to get to the database, but we will soon be creating PHP pages
		that might give them some opportunities.
		So let's go ahead and deal with the problem now.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Add <a href="sanitize-html.txt">this</a> function to the config file.
			It would be a really good exercise in learning PHP to pick this function apart, and understand what it does!
		</li>
		<li>
			Now go back to the getPageById() method and 'wrap' the content coming from the database like <a href="screen-shots/4-sanitizing-the-content.png">this</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Follow Up Questions:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>What are HTTP headers?</li>
		<li>What is the purpose of a 404 status code header?</li>
		<li>What are some other HTTP status codes?</li>
		<li>What is the purpose of the mysqli_real_escape_string() function? (Not sure if this is a fair question at this point in the course)</li>
		<li>What are the SEO implications of using a single page to display all blog posts?</li>
		<li>What happens if you try to view a blog page that is not 'active' (the 'active' column for the row is set to 'no')?</li>
		<li>What is an XSS attack?</li>
	</ul>
