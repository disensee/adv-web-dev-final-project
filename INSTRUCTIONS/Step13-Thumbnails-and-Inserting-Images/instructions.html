	<h1>Thumbnails and Inserting Images into Blog Posts</h1>
	<p>
		In this step we'll assemble some parts to complete the blog-details.php page.
		We'll use a PHP class to allow us to create thumbnails of images that are uploaded.
		And we'll also use a library for adding a <b>rich text editor</b> to our blog details page.
	</p>
	<h3>Pre-Reqs</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>TinyMCE Demo</li>
		<li>ImageResizer Demo</li>
		<li>Understanding of JavaScript Event Delegation</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Getting Started</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				Before we start, lets delete any files in the files table.
				Open PHPMyAdmin and run this command in the SQL tab:
			</p>
			<pre>
TRUNCATE TABLE files;	
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			Also, delete any files that have been uploaded to the <b>uploaded-files</b> folder.
			If you do not have a folder named <b>uploaded-files</b>, then add it to your <b>my-new-site</b> folder.
			We'll put all uploaded files into this folder.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>
		Creating Thumbnails when Images are Uploaded
	</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Create a folder named <b>thumbnails</b> inside the 'uploaded-files' folder.
			All of our thumbnail images will be stored here.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add these constants to the config file (for both the DEV and LIVE environments).
			<pre>
define("THUMBNAIL_FOLDER", UPLOAD_FOLDER . "thumbnails/");
define("SERVER_THUMBNAIL_FOLDER", SERVER_UPLOAD_FOLDER . "thumbnails/");
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			In the 'includes' folder, create a file called <b>ImageUploader.inc.php</b>
			and put <a href="image-uploader-class.txt">this</a> code in it.
			You don't need to understand any code in this class (unless you want to).
			All you need to know is that it can be used to resize images, and you need to know how to use it's API.
			This means that you know how to call it's methods, pass in the proper parameters, and work with the return values.
			It might seem strange to use code that you don't understand in a project, but it happens often.
			There's a saying among programmers; "don't re-invent the wheel". 
			Good programmers will learn how to use existing tools that are available before trying to build them from scratch.
			Just be careful, when you use other people's code, you are putting a lot of trust in them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Open file-details.php and include the ImageUploader class at the top of the page, like this:
			<pre>
require_once("../includes/ImageUploader.inc.php");				
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			Now, in the file-details.php page, find the code that renames our uploaded file
			(it's in an IF statement that throws an exception if the rename fails, the exception message is: Unable too rename file).
			Underneath that IF statement, add this code:
			<pre>
// Create a thumbnail of the image 
// (this is basically step 3 from the image resizer demo)
$imgUploader = new ImageUploader($max_file_size, $allowed_file_types);
$thumbNailPath = SERVER_THUMBNAIL_FOLDER . $newFileName;
$resize_width = 150;								
$resize_height = 200;

// resize the image...
$resize_result = $imgUploader-&gt;resizeImage($newFilePath, $thumbNailPath, $resize_width, $resize_height);

// $resize_result will be an array that has some details about the final size of the image
if($resize_result ==  false){
	throw new Exception("Unable to resize the image.");
}
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			Open the file-details.php page in the browser and upload an image.
			Then check the thumbnails folder to make sure the thumbnail of the image was properly created.
		</li>
	</ol>
 

	<h3>Create the Image List Page</h3>
	<p>
		I'm going to keep you in the dark for a bit regarding how we'll use this page.
		But if you have seen the tinyMce demo, you might be able to predict what we are getting at.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			First, make sure you have at least two images uploaded.
			If not, open the file-details page and upload a few images.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a file in the control-panel folder and call it <b>image-list.php</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Paste <a href="image-list.txt">this</a> code into the page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Open image-list.php in the browser. You'll have to login before you can view the page. 
			You should see a table displaying your thumbnail images.
		</li>
		<li>
			Take a look at the code for this page, and note the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					We are reusing code (rather than duplicating it) by using the getFileList() method of the FileDataAccess class.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the html code, we set up a table, and then use PHP to loop through the files and create a table row for each one.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the createTableRow() function, we invoke the createFileLink() function in order to fill in the last column in each row.
					Right now, the createFileLink() method simply returns a string that says "TODO", but we'll add code to change that in the next step.
					I wanted you to get an overall idea of how the page works before we dive into the gory details.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Replace the createFileLink() function <a href="createFileLink.txt">this</a> code.
		</li>
		<li>
			Let's talk about the code that's in this function.
			<ul>
				<li>
					First, it will return a string that looks something like this:
					<pre>
&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)"  class="insertImg" data-filename="1.png" data-filedescription="Code sample 1"&gt;INSERT&lt;/a&gt;						
					</pre>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
					We've put <b>javascript:void(0)</b> as the value of the HREF attribute because we don't actually want the link to take us to a different page.
					The book for this course has an example that uses a similar approach (chapter 11), where it used something like this for the href attribute:
					<b>href="javascript:someFunction()"</b>.
					We could have used this approach, but there is a better way that uses JavaScript <b>event delegation</b>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Each anchor tag will have a class attribute set to <b>insertImg</b>.
					You'll see how we make use of this soon (when we use event delegation).
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
					We've embedded some <b>custom attributes</b> into the anchor tag (data-filename and data-filedescription).
					<b>Embedding custom attributes into tags is an extremely powerful tool!</b>
					Custom attributes allow you to bind certain information to your UI, by adding attributes to HTML tags (this is a form of <b>data-binding</b>).
					Then you can use JavaScript code to access this information.
					Note that these <b>a</b> tags are created by our server-side code (PHP).
					So it allows us to transfer information from our server-side code to our client-side code (we are using PHP code to generate client-side code).
					</p>
					<p>
					When you add your own custom attributes to a tag, you should prefix the attribute name with <b>data-</b>.
					For more information, <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/how-why-use-html5-custom-data-attributes/" target="_blank">click here</a>. 
					We'll see how these custom attributes will be used soon.
					</p>
					<p><b>Note: you cannot use capital letters in custom attribute names.</b> Read the link for more info.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					We'll make use of these custom attributes soon!
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Update the Blog Details Page</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Open the blog-details.php page and add <a href="script-tags.txt">this</a> code to the HTML just above the opening MAIN tag.	
			Here are some notes regarding this bit of code:
			<ul>
				<li>The first script tag imports the tinyMce library</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The code in the second script tag waits for the page to load, and then uses PHP code to set some variables in JavaScript.
						Some programmers would have a real problem with this (they might say that you should never use PHP to generate JavaScript code).
						But it can be done, and it's very convenient for us in this case!
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, the last statment (which spans quite a few lines) sets up the tinyMce editor.
						Note that the 'selector' option is targeting the textarea tag that displays the content of a blog page.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Load the blog details page in the browser, and make sure that the tinyMce editor is getting initialized properly.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add this code under the 'content' textarea (the textarea tag that has it's 'name' attribute set to 'content'):
			<pre>
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;input type="button" value="Insert Image" id="btnInsertImg" /&gt;
			</pre>
			When this button is pressed, we'll open a popup window that displays all the images that we've uploaded.
			<br><br>
		</li>
		<li>
			Now let's add the event handler for the button we just added. 
			Paste this code just under the comment that says STEP 2:
			<pre>
// when the 'Insert Image' button is pressed, create a popup window
document.getElementById("btnInsertImg").addEventListener("click", function(){
	createWindow(400,300);
});
			</pre>
			Note that if you run the code now, you'll get an error when you click the button
			because we have not yet defined the createWindow() function. 
			We'll do that next.
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			Paste <a href="createWindow.txt">this</a> code just under the comment that says STEP 3.
			This code should look familiar (I got it straight out of the book for this class, I just and made a few tweaks to it).
			It creates a popup window and then uses <b>event delegation</b> to listen for clicks in the window.
			If a 'click' event occurs on an A tag that has a class of 'insertImg', our event handler function will extract
			the data embedded in the custom attributes of the tag.
			</p>
			<p>
				Go ahead and try it out.
				But note that you'll get an error when you click on one of the A tags in the popup window.
				That's because we haven't defined the insertImg() function yet. 
				We'll do that next.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Paste <a href="insertImg.txt">this</a> code under the comment that says STEP 4.
				Note that it uses the new 'template' syntax in JavaScript to create an IMG tag that will be inserted into the tinyMce editor.
				This is JavaScript's way of doing <b>variable interpolation</b> (remember that we talked about variable interpolation when we first started learning PHP).
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Finally, try out the page and insert an image or two into a blog post.
			Then make sure to view the blog post in the front end.
		</li>
		<li>
			Note that if our project folder paths are different on dev and live, then
			we will have some problems to overcome. The image links won't work on both.
			But we could fix this by using a regular expression when the blog-details page is posted.
			The reg exp could search and replace all instances of the path to the uploaded-files folder with something like UPLOAD_FOLDER before putting the data in the database.
			Then, when we fetch the blog page from the database we could replace all instances of UPLOAD_FOLDER with the path that is appropriate for the environment that the code is running on.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Follow Up Questions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			In the image-list.php page, there is a comment (in the createTableRow() function)
			about how it would have been better pull the 'real file name' in our database query.
			How could we have done this? Why would it have been a better approach?
		</li>
		<li>
			What is <b>event delegation</b>?
		</li>
		<li>
			What are <b>custom attributes</b>?
		</li>
		<li>
			Why is it important for web developers to know how to set up a rich text editor?
		</li>
