	<h1>Side Bars</h1>
	<h3>Create an Include File for a Side Bar</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Create file in the <b>includes</b> folder and name it <b>hobbies-sidebar.inc.php</b></li>
		<li>
			Open the blog home page (blog/index.php) and do the following:
			<ol>
				<li>Cut the ASIDE tag out and paste it into hobbies-sidebar.inc.php. Don't forget to update the link in hobbies-sidebar.inc.php to the light house image (use IMAGES_DIR).</li>
				<li>Add the code that is selected in <a href="screen-shots/1-blog-homepage.png">this</a> screen shot to the blog home page (line 6, and lines 22-24)</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Updating the CSS</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Although we just declared and initialized the $sideBar variable, let's comment out that line for now.
			The page should still work, you just won't see the side bar when you look at it in the browser.
		</li>
		<li>
			Open the main.css file and set the background color of the MAIN tag to yellow.
		</li>
		<li>
			View the blog page in the browser and note that the main tag does not take up the full width of the page when there is no side bar.
		</li>
		<li>
			Update header.inc.php to look like <a href="screen-shots/2-header-include.png">this</a>. We add a variable named $contentClass near the top, and use it below on line 29. DON'T MISS THE PHP ON LINE 29!
		</li>
		<li>
			Add <a href="screen-shots/3-css.png">this</a> CSS code to the style sheet (main.css).
		</li>
		<li>Refresh the blog home page in the browser.</li>
		<li>We could talk about CSS <b>specificity</b> now.</li>
		<li>Remove the yellow background from the MAIN tag.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Updating the Rest of the Pages</h3>
	<p>
		Leave the blog home page without a side bar for now, but update the other pages in the same way and have them display the hobbies sidebar
		Here are the steps to repeat in the other pages:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Remove the aside tag from each page.</li>
		<li>Add the $sideBar variable and initialize it to a value of <b>hobbies-sidebar.inc.php</b></li>
		<li>Add the IF statement PHP code to the bottom of the page (DON'T use ../ in the path to the sidebar include file)</li>
		<li>Test the page in the browser</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>
		Note the pattern we are following on our pages:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Include the config file first</li>
		<li>Set page specific variables (we could store these values in a database if we wanted to, which would give us a new level of flexibility)</li>
		<li>Display the header (which uses the page specific variable settings)</li>
		<li>Display the page content</li>
		<li>Display the side bar (if there is one)</li>
		<li>Display the footer</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Our site is becoming more dynamic and flexible (the css code changes based on whether or not there is a side bar shown on the page!)
		And because we've arranged things using include files, our site is much easier to maintain!
	</p>
