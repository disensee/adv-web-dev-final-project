	<h1>Blog Home Page</h1>
	<h3>Pre-Reqs</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Complete at least the first step in the OOPhp assignment</b></li>
		<li>Understanding of PHP and MySQL (and how they work together)</li>
		<li>Understanding of PHPMyAdmin</li>
		<li>Understanding of OOP, Constructors and Classes in PHP</li>
		<li>Understanding of <b>optional parameters</b></li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		In this step we are going to work on the blog pages for our site.
		The blog pages will get their content from the database, so we'll start off by setting it up in PHPMyAdmin.
		We'll also have to create a few other files before we start on the blog home page.
		Up until now, we have used the procedural style of programming in PHP.
		Now we'll start using classes and objects in our code.
		(I debated on whether or not to use inheritance right away, but decided not to, just to keep things simple).
	</p>

	<h3>Setting Up The Database</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Open PHPMyAdmin and create a new database called <b>my-new-site</b></li>
		<li>
			In the 'my-new-site' databse, run the SQL statements <a href="SQL.txt">here</a>.
			The SQL queries will create two tables, <b>pages</b> and categories.
			They also insert some 'dummy' data into the database for us.
			We'll discuss the tables and columns.
			Note that the 'path' column in the 'pages' is a bit of a mystery now, but it will be used to greatly improve our SEO in the future
			Note that the SQL adds two 'test' blog posts, just to give us something to work with.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Add code to the config file to connect to the database</h3>
	<p>
		We'll add some code that connects to the database.
		And since a few of our pages will use this code, we'll put it in the config file.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Add the following constants to the config file: <b>DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME</b>.
		Note that they will be set to different values on the dev and live environments.
		The code should look like <a href="screen-shots/1-db-settings.png">this</a>.
		For the dev settings, you should be able to use the sames values for each of the constants that are in the screen shot.
		Later, we'll set up the database on the live site, and you'll change the values for connecting the the live database later.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add <a href="screen-shots/2-db-link-function.png">this</a> code to the bottom of the config file.
			We'll discuss this code in class, but for now just note that the function will initialize the $link variable,
			if it has not already been initialized.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Create the PageDataAccess class</h3>
	<p>
		Note that our book duplicates a lot of code when it comes to access the database.
		We are going to take a turn toward object-oriented PHP now.
		Instead of putting SQL queries directly in our web pages (as the book does),
		we will put all SQL queries regarding blog pages into a class. 
		This will make our code more flexible, re-usable, maintainable, and testable.
		When we add a new page to our site that needs to access the database we'll use this class rather than duplicate the code in each page.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Create a file in the <b>includes</b> folder called <b>PageDataAccess.inc.php</b>.
			Note that the file name starts with a capital P, which indicates that this is a class.
			<a href="screen-shots/3-page-data-access.png">This</a> is the code you should put in it (I've included the actual code in a pre tag so that you can cut and paste it.)
			Note that there is no closing php tag (<b>?&gt;</b>) because this is an include file.
			We may need to discuss the DATE_FORMAT() function in MySQL (the %e shows the month number without leading zeros).
			We should discuss why I use <b>OR handleError()</b> instead of die() - when your dead your dead, by using handleError() we can do things, such as redirect to our friendly error page.
			We may also want to add a custom exception handler (we added a custom error handler, but not exception handler).
			<pre>
&lt;?php
class PageDataAccess{
	
	private $link;

	// CONSTRUCTOR
	function __construct($link){
		$this->link = $link;
	}

	// We'll invoke this method when we encounter a database error
	function handleError($msg){
		throw new Exception($msg);
	}

	// Get a listing of all blog pages
	function getPageList($activeOnly = true){

		$qStr = "SELECT pageId, path, title, DATE_FORMAT(publishedDate,'%m/%e/%Y') as publishedDate, active FROM pages";
		
		if($activeOnly){
			$qStr .= " WHERE active = 'yes'";
		}

		$qStr .= " ORDER BY publishedDate DESC";
		//die($qStr);

		$result = mysqli_query($this->link, $qStr) or $this->handleError(mysqli_error($this->link));

		$pageList = array();

		while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)){
			$page = array();
			$page['pageId'] = htmlentities($row['pageId']);
			$page['path'] = htmlentities($row['path']);
			$page['title'] = htmlentities($row['title']);
			$page['publishedDate'] = htmlentities($row['publishedDate']);
			$page['active'] = htmlentities($row['active']);
			$pageList[] = $page;
		}

		return $pageList;
	}
	
}
			</pre>
			We will test this code in the next page that we create.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a new folder called <b>tests</b> and put it inside the <b>my-new-site</b> folder.
		</li>
		<li>
			Inside the tests folder, create a file named <b>page-data-access-tests.php</b>
			Then put <a href="screen-shots/4-test-page.png">this</a> code into the page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Open the test page in the browser, and make sure it's properly fetching the data from the database.
			Now we have the confidence to know that our data access code is working properly before we use it in the blog home page.
			This is a very crude form of <b>unit testing</b>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Hooking up the Blog Home Page</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Open the blog home page (blog/index.php)</li>
		<li>Add <a href="screen-shots/5-use-page-data-access-in-blog-home-page.png">this</a> code just under the link to the config file.</li>
		<li>
			Add <a href="screen-shots/6-createBlogList.png">this</a> function to the bottom of the page. Here it is inside a pre tag:
			<pre>
// wraps the blog pages in an unordered list
function createBlogList($pages){

	$html = "&lt;ul class=\"blog-list\"&gt;";

	foreach ($pages as $p) {
		$html .= "&lt;li&gt;";
		$html .= 	"&lt;a href=\"blog-post.php?pageId=" . $p['pageId'] . "\"&gt;";
		$html .= 		$p['title'];
		$html .= 	"&lt;/a&gt;";
		$html .= "&lt;/li&gt;";
		
	}

	$html .= "&lt;/ul&gt;";
	return $html;
}			
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			Finally, let's invoke the function we just created and echo out the html string that it returns.
			The PHP code should go just under the the H3 tag on the page.
			You can remove the P tag that is currently under the H3 tag.
			Your code should look like <a href="screen-shots/7-calling-createBlogList.png">this</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Open the blog home page in the browser.
			Note that the blog post links to a page that we have not yet created.
			We'll create that page in the next step of the project.
			Also note that the link url include has the pageId embedded in it as a <b>url query string variable</b> aka <b>url parameter</b>.
